  <h2>about</h2>

  <p>dmangame is about writing an AI to play a simplified Realtime Strategy
  Game.  There is no 'playing' done by humans, the game is played by various AI.
  Each AI controls a team of units that it is able to communicate with.  The AI's
  objective is to crush its enemies and hear the lamentation of their pixels.</p>

  <p>Your objective is to code this AI.</p>

  <h2>pics or stfu</h2>

  <p>Here's <a href="http://dmangame.github.io/dmangame/circleblaster_vs_expand.html">an example game</a> (saved using the -o option).</p>

  <p>The little moving dots inside transparent circles are units. The circle is the
  unit's field of vision.  The line behind the unit is its path from their
  location on the previous turn. Sometimes they shoot bullets (the slightly
  thinner line) towards other units.</p>

  <p>The stationary black outlined dots are buildings. Notice how buildings spawn
  units at the same time.</p>

  <h2>gimme</h2>

  <p>You can find the latest version of the source code on <a href="http://github.com/dmangame/dmangame">github</a></p>

  <h2>dependencies</h2>

  <p>If using graphics, pygtk (which should include cairo).</p>

  <p>If not, then just python.</p>

  <h2>running it</h2>

  <pre><code class="prettyprint">
# Play with graphics
python main.py ai/captureai.py ai/killncapture.py

# Play without graphics and a web replay. Open output.html to view the game replay.
# NOTE: This file is a massive JSON crusty file. If you want to copy it
# somewhere, make sure to compress it (scp -C) or gzip it first.
python main.py ai/capture.ai ai/killncapture.py -c -o output.html

# Use NCURSES GUI (Game output gets saved to game.log and game.out)
python main.py ai/capture.ai ai/killncapture.py -cn

# Play on a specific map
python main.py ai/capture.ai ai/killncapture.py -m maps/micro.py

# Show AI debug highlighting for AIs.
# Note: Each AI must have --hl before it to enable highlighting.
# See the Debugging section for more information.
# In this instance, only simpleAI gets highlighting.
python main.py --hl ai/simpleai.py ai/basepatroller.py

# Help
python main.py --help
