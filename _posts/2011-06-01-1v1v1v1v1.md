Firstly, some new AIs have been seen around town:

 * SwarmAI, by [karethoth][4] - an AI based around reacting to enemy movements.

 * WedgeAI, by [behindcurtain3][0] is now competing in the ladder. Because of Wedge, I've also implemented a remote dependency system for AI - check the README in dmanai for more information.

the ladder has also been split into per map rankings,
visible on the [ladder page][3].

finally, you may have noticed that there are some matches
going up recently that have multiple AI in them - these are
1v1v1...v1 matches and are now counting towards an AI's
skill level. The skill level is calculated using the xbox
[trueskill ranking system] [1] and [dmj111's python
implementation][2] which is able to rank games with more
than one player in them.
