Hey! You! Yeah... you!

Think you can code the *best* AI?

Interested in finding out?

Register your AI to compete in the monthly dmangame ladder matches and like the
roman gladiators, they will battle during the day and rest at night (while you
beat them into shape). Followed by robot orgies. But only for the winner.

And best of all, it's run off github, so your AI is always up to date.  It's
simple to start competing: just fork the [dmanai repository][dmanai_repo] and
get going.  Actually, be sure to read the README, too.

To see how your AI is doing, visit the [ladder page on dmangame-app][ladder]

#### Notes for jerks:

* 1) Daytime in the PST
* 2) Yes, technically your AI won't have an orgy. Get over it.
