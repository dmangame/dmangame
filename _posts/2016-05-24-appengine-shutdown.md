title: dmangame no longer on app engine
author: okay

after watching dmangame's HTML5 viewer suffer bit rot for a few years, i've
decided to take the game off app engine. games will still be playable locally,
but tournaments will not be running on a dedicated app engine instance any longer.

the main reason for taking the app engine instance down is that the HTML blobs
that were being stored are no longer viewable in modern browsers (because of an
extra semi-colon!) and it appears difficult to recover from. so - it's been a
fun ride, app engine - but we are going to have to part ways for now.
