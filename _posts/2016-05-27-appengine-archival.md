title: dmangame matches on appengine archived
author: okay

i spoke too soon in the last update: it was possible to recover from the broken HTML, so now
the matches on [the appengine instance](http://dmangame-hrd.appspot.com) are viewable, but the Files
API has been deprecated, so no new matches can be run for now
