#### dmangame at pyclass

This coming Monday, June 20th, [pyclass SF][pyclass_sf], hosted in noisebridge,
is going to be writing AIs for dmangame. I wrote a [slide deck][1] (using
[powjs][0] by chromakode), for those who are unable to make it in person. The
class will cover both python fundamentals and AI discussions.
